        <p>Ramen is a Japanese noodle dish. It consists of Chinese-style wheat noodles served in a meat-based broth,

    <h3>Steps to make your delicious Ramen:-</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat sesame oil and olive oil in a medium-large saucepan over moderate heat . Add garlic and ginger, and simmer until 
            <br>fragrant, about 2-3 minutes. Do not brown the garlic, or else you'll get a bitter flavor.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the carrots and mushrooms if you're using them, and simmer until they soften, <br>
            about a minute, stirring frequently.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the broth, Sriracha sauce, rice vinegar, and soy sauce. Stir, and bring to a simmer; let it go for about five minutes. <br>
            Taste, and adjust heat and taste to your liking by adding more Sriracha and soy sauce if needed.
        </li>
        <li>
            While the broth simmers, cook the Ramen noodles in a separate pot as per the package's instructions. (You could cook the <br>
            noodles in the broth directly, but that makes for a messy transfer to a bowl. It's much easier to transfer drained cooked noodles <br>
            to a bowl and spoon the broth over top.) Once the noodles are tender, drain and rinse under cool water, place into a soup bowl, <br>
            and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            When the soup is ready, spoon the broth over the noodles. Allow to cool. At this point, make your soft-boiled egg <br>
            if you're garnishing with one, and add the rest of your toppings to serve.
        </li>
        <li>Finally add your soft boiled egg after removing the shells and place it on top of the ramen and <b> your Ramen is ready !!</b></li>

    </ol>
