        <h3>Onigiri Is A Common Japanese Food</h3>
        <p>Onigiri are Japanese rice balls, which appear in a couple of Naruto's scenes. One such moment takes place when Sakura
           and Sasuke are kids. Sakura stares at Sasuke from a far, watching him eat his Onigiri.  </p><br>
        <h3>About Onigiri</h3>
        <p>Onigiri, also known as omusubi, nigirimeshi, or rice ball, is a Japanese food made from white rice formed into triangular 
           or cylindrical shapes and often wrapped in nori.
    <h3>Onigiri Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Rice</li>
        <li>Furikake </li>
        <li>Nori</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps to make Onigiri</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Pop your cooked rice into a nice mixing bowl. Add the furikake or rice flavouring and mix through evenly. Separate 
            <br> the rice into equal portions, big enough to be a large handful each.
        </li>
        <li>
            Wet your hands with water and rub together with a pinch or two of salt. This stops the rice sticking to your <br>
            hands and helps keep it fresher for longer.
        </li>
        <li>
            Take up one portion of rice in your hands.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you are hiding some fillings inside, here is where you make an indent, place the ingredients inside and fold 
            <br>the rice over, then lightly press into a ball.
        </li>
        <li>
            Using mainly your fingertips while resting the rice on your palm, start to press and squeeze the rice into a triangular shape,
            <br>rotating as you go so itâ€™s even.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place a slice of nori on the bottom of the onigiri (the rough side should face the rice) and fold it up towards to 
            <br>the middle of the onigiri and <b>Your onigiri rice balls are ready to eat !!</b>
        </li>
    </ol>
