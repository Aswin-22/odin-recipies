        <h3>Both Heroes And Villains Enjoy Dango</h3>
        <p>Dango is one of the most prevalent foods in Naruto, and viewers have no shortage of scenes where a wide range of characters eat it. 
           Usually, villains don't appear to eat desserts, as they are too busy scheming and creating their evil plans. But contrary to what 
           viewers expect, Obito and Deidara are shown eating Dango. </p><br>
